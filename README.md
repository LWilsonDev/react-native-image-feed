## Image Feed App

This is my WIP for a react-native app showing a feed of images from Unsplash, kind of like an Instagram clone.

I have mostly followed the tutorial in **Fullstack React-Native** published by fullstack.io, but I have converted the class-based components to be functional components instead, making use of UseState hooks.

This is just for my own educational purposes, and is by no means a finished app. There are a lot of areas for improvement, such as the image rendering, the lack of responsive design, and the lack of accessibility props and labels. For now, this is simply an exercise in using some of React-Native's core components, and getting to grips with state in functional components.
